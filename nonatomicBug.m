In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises from the interaction between properties declared with `nonatomic` and concurrent access.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSMutableArray *dataArray;

- (void)updateData:(NSArray *)newData {
    [self.dataArray addObjectsFromArray:newData];
}
```

If multiple threads call `updateData` concurrently without proper synchronization, data races can occur.  `nonatomic` indicates that the compiler won't generate atomic accessors, leading to unpredictable behavior. The array might be modified inconsistently, resulting in crashes or corrupted data.
